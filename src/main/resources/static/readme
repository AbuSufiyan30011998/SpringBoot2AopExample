CHAPTER # 7 SPRING AOP
AOP (Aspect Oriented Programming):-
 It is used for “Cross-cutting-concern ” . It means separate business logic 
and external services.
 External service must behave as plug-in-code, that is without modifying 
exited application, programmer, should able to add/remove external 
services Example are :- Log4j,UnitTest,security,JMS,Crytography,Encode 
and decode request/response ,filter management, request identity 
process, etc………………………..
AOP Terms
1. Aspect:- It is a class, which indicates external services logic.
2. Advice:- It is a method inside Aspect (class). It is also called as 
implementation of Aspect.
3. Pointcut: It is an expression which select the business class method to 
connect with advice. But it will not tell which advice it is
4. Joinpoint:- It is a combination of Advice and Pointcut expression . It 
means “joinpoint says which business class method need what and how 
many advice. 
5. Target :- It is a pure business class object (before adding/without 
external services logic).
6. Weaving :- It is process done by weaver (sub component of spring 
container ).It will add advice logic to target based on join points.
7. Proxy:- It is a final output of weaving which contains business class logic 
and selected advices logic.
** ie Code linked at object level, not at class level.
